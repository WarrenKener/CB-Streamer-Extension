# Chaturbate Model Extension for Chrome

This browser extension is for Chrome and is installed by putting the all the files in this repository into a folder on your hard drive, then going to Chrome options > More tools > Extensions. With developer mode enabled, click the button "load unpacked" and select the aforementioned folder.

atm, this extension will show any Private Messages you receive as a broadcaster above the Chat area, & without the broadcaster needing to click the PM tab and then User to see the PM. No mouse use is required anymore, simply read the PMs you receive as you receive them near where you are used to seeing chat messages already, without lifting a finger or touching your computer or mouse in any way. PMs have an orange background, regular chat messages have a yellow one. If you have a PM tab open, you see PMs from other users & public chat messages. If you have the Chat tab open, you see all incoming PMs.

More features are to come. Next on the docket is a simple chat log, a feature I've already coded and have only to add to this project. Eventually many more features are intended, such as audio notifications on certain users joining your room, running tip totals displayed next to usernames that are only visible to the streamer, tip income analysis along multiple dimensions, text-to-speech, a tip based jukebox, a chat connector for discord guilds, and much more.

All the love,
Warren
